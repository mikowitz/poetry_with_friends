Once upon a sea upheaving Aeneas wandered, lost and grieving,
Grieving for the loss of life that swept him from the trojan shore.
Pursued by Juno's savage ire, until, at last, the Roman spires
Standing on the hills of Latium might into the heavens soar.
With the muse guiding my memory, let my voice to heaven soar.
    Of this I sing, a man and war.

In Africa an ancient nation set their city's strong foundations:
Carthage, which the goddess Juno loved beyond her Samian shores.
Here her armor, here her horses, through her breast desire courses
That her city might someday arise and o'er the world be lord.
But rumor whispers of a people, born from blood of Trojan lords,
    who shall reign forevermore.
