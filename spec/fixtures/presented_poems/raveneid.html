<ol class="stanza">
<li>Once upon a sea upheaving Aeneas wandered, lost and grieving,</li>
<li>Grieving for the loss of life that swept him from the trojan shore.</li>
<li>Pursued by Juno&#x27;s savage ire, until, at last, the Roman spires</li>
<li>Standing on the hills of Latium might into the heavens soar.</li>
<li>With the muse guiding my memory, let my voice to heaven soar.</li>
<li class="indent">Of this I sing, a man and war.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="stanza">
<li>In Africa an ancient nation set their city&#x27;s strong foundations:</li>
<li>Carthage, which the goddess Juno loved beyond her Samian shores.</li>
<li>Here her armor, here her horses, through her breast desire courses</li>
<li>That her city might someday arise and o&#x27;er the world be lord.</li>
<li>But rumor whispers of a people, born from blood of Trojan lords,</li>
<li class="indent">who shall reign forevermore.</li>
</ol>
